# RakshAI 🚨  
**AI-Powered Multilingual Emergency Triage for Disaster Zones**

RakshAI is a lightweight, multilingual AI system designed to assist people during disasters by providing **real-time emergency triage, safety guidance, and prioritization** when human responders are overwhelmed.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** RakshAI provides AI-based assistance only.  
> For life-threatening emergencies, always contact official emergency services.

## 🌍 Problem Statement
During disasters, emergency helplines are often overloaded.  
People report emergencies in different languages, networks are unreliable, and responders struggle to quickly identify **who needs help first**.

This delay can cost lives.

---

## 🎯 Solution
RakshAI acts as a **digital first responder** that:
- Accepts emergency reports in multiple languages
- Uses AI to classify urgency and priority
- Provides immediate, safe action steps
- Helps responders focus on the most critical cases first

---

## ✨ Core Features

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Citizen Emergency Chat
- Multilingual chat (English, Hindi, Telugu, Tamil)
- Emergency quick buttons (Fire, Flood, Accident, Trapped, Food/Water)
- WhatsApp-style chat interface
- Location input (text-based)
- AI-generated response cards:
  - Priority (P1–P4)
  - Urgency score (0–100)
  - Category

---

### 🧠 AI Triage Engine
Each user message is analyzed to produce:
- **Priority Levels**
  - P1 🔴 Critical
  - P2 🟠 Urgent
